# VCThemeGUI

This is a simple GUI for editing the CSS for specifically editing the **backdrop/background** of Discord+ and SoftX, themes for Vencord and BetterDiscord. It allows you to set the backdrop of Discord+ by selecting an existing or added url to an image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif) from the dropdown instead of going into the file yourself and manually editing or commenting out images.

This allows you to more easily store multiple backdrops for the theme and swap between them without having to work within the text css file itself for simpler access.

****This was made for personal Vencord use and I have not tested with other modded clients, but the css files should be same except for directory locations.**

### -----------------------------------------------------------------------
## How to use:
-  Open the GUI exe (VCTheme.exe)
- Go to File → Open in top left corner, then select the Discord+ theme CSS file for your modded discord.
- Use **Select Backdrop** in bottom left corner to open dropdown menu so you can swap between existing backdrops
- Use **Add Backdrop** in bottom right corner to add new backdrops into the file and Backdrop menu
    - Only supports image/gif links with common appropriate extensions (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif)
         - Can upload a local image to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload) or other media sites then open your uploaded image in a new tab and copy that link to be inserted as a backdrop (See GIF example below)

**Imgur Demo:**
(Upload image → open image in new tab → copy url for use)
